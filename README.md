# Team-Profile-Generator

# Description
We were tasked with creating an automated team profile generator. Once the user starts the program they will be lead through a series of prompts to gather information on their team memebers to be compiled into a team porforlio. The program will start by asking about the team manager. Once the manager's info has been submitted users will then be asked if they'd like to add additional team members. It will ask if the new team member is an engineer or intern, and then ask the appropriate questions for each. Once the user is done adding team members the program will add the user submitted data to a generated html page.
